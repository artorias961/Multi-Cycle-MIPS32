# Multi-Cycle MIPS32 Processor (Verilog / Quartus)

## Overview
This repository contains a **complete implementation of a multi-cycle MIPS32 processor** written in **Verilog**, designed for **FPGA synthesis using Intel Quartus** and verified through **Questa/ModelSim simulation**.

The project follows the **classic multi-cycle datapath architecture** described in standard computer architecture texts (e.g., Patterson & Hennessy). It is intended as an **educational yet fully functional CPU design**, demonstrating control FSM design, datapath sequencing, and instruction execution over multiple cycles.
